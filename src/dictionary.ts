This is fun because it's a play on words.

Don't include phrasal verbs that have a direct translation.
Don't include phrasal verbs that have a directions like "up" or "down", or "in" or "out".
Don't use special characters in the phrasal verbs.

{
    frasal: "velocidad de dios", // The phrasal verb to match
    english: "godspeed", // The English translation/meaning
    spanish: "buena suerte" // The proper Spanish translation
}
